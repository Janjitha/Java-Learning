4. Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes.
The three things are in a square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively.
Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

INPUT FORMAT:
First input: a side of the square in integer
Second input: length of a rectange in integer 
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

OUTPUT FORMAT:
The first output should be the area of a square in integer
The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer
The third output should be the area of circle in float with 2 decimal points

		System.out.println("Breadth of a rectangle:");
		int breadth = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Radius of circle:");

		int a=side*side;
		System.out.println("Area of square:" +a);
		int b=length * breadth;
		System.out.println("Area of rectangle:" +b);
		double r=(3.14*radius*radius)*100;
		System.out.printf("%.02f",Math.floor(r)*0.01);

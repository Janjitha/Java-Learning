	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Principle:");
		int p = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Period of years:");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Rate of interest:");
		float r = sc.nextFloat();
		
		float result = (p*n*r)/100;
		System.out.printf("%.2f",result);
		

	}

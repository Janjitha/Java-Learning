She planted the mango tree only in a first row, first column and last column. So, given the number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.

INPUT FORMAT:
First input denotes the number of rows
Second input denotes the number of columns 
Third input denotes the tree number

OUTPUT FORMAT:
  Print yes or no

OUTPUT:-

import java.util.Scanner;

public class MangoTree_10 {

public static void main(String[] args) {
		        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);	   
		        System.out.println("Enter the number of rows:");
		        int rows = scanner.nextInt();
		        System.out.println("Enter the number of columns:");
		        int columns = scanner.nextInt();
		        System.out.println("Enter the tree number:");
		        int treeNumber = scanner.nextInt();		     
		        if (treeNumber <= columns || (treeNumber - 1) % columns == 0 ||  treeNumber % columns == 0) {
		            System.out.println("Yes, it is a Mango Tree.");
		        } else {
		            System.out.println("No, it is not a Mango Tree.");
		        }

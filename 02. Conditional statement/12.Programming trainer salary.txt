Jeevitha just started work as a programming trainer for UIT'S placement cell. She is paid Rs.100 an hour, with a few exceptions.
She earns an extra Rs.15 an hour for any part of a day where she works more than 8 hours,and an extra Rs.25 an hour for hours beyond 40 in any one week. 
also, she earns a 25% bonus for working on Saturday and a 50% bonus for working on sunday.  The bonuses for Saturday and sunday are computed 
based on the hours worked those days; they are not used to calculate any bonus for working more than 40 hours in a week.  
You'll be given the number of hours Jeevitha worked on each day in a week(Sunday, Monday,..., Saturday),and you need to compute her salary for the week.

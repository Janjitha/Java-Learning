12.The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are : if n is even ; n=n/2 . if n is odd ; n=3n+1 . For Example , if the starting number is 5 the sequence is : 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 ->2 -> 1 . It has been proved for almost all integer , the repeated application of the above rule will result in the sequence that ends at 1 . 

INPUT FORMAT:
the input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to be applied in order to reach 1.


OUTPUT:-

import java.util.Scanner;
public class CollatzSequence_12 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the number:");
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		System.out.print(n + "->");
		while(n!=1) {
			if(n%2==0) {
				n=n/2;
			}
			else {
				n=3*n+1;
			}
			if(n==1) {
				System.out.print(n);
			}
			else {
				System.out.print(n + "->");
			}
		}
		
	}

}

OUTPUT FOR THE CODE:
Enter the number:
5
5->16->8->4->2->1

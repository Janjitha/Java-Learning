4. Drona normally trains his disiplines using a board which consists of concentric circles.  When the student correctly hits the centre of the concentric circles, his score is 100. The score gets reduced depending on where the students hit on the board. When the students hits outside the board, his score is 0.  Drona will not allow a student to have his food unless he scores 100. Arjuna will always hit the target in his first attempt and he will leave easily.  Other may take more turns to reach a score of 100.  Can you write a program to determine the number of turns a disciples takes to reach the target score of 'n'?

INPUT FORMAT:
Input consists of a list of positive integers.  The first integer corresponds to the target score'n'. Assume that all the other integers input are less than or equal ton.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output consists of a single line.  Refer sample output for format details.
